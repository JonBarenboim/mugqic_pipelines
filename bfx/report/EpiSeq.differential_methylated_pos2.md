### Differentially Methylated Positions
The output tables for each contrast specified in the design configuration file can be found [here](data/differential_methylated_pos/differential_methylated_pos.zip). No particular visual is available at the moment. The R library packages used in this step is [Minfi]([@minfi]) and [BiSeq]([@biseq]).
