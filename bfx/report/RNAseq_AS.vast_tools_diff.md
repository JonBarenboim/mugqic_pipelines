#### Alternative Splicing with Vast Tools

Vast Tools was used for profiling and comparing alternative splicing events.

It aligned the reads and calculated PSI values. The output can be found [here](INCLUSION_LEVELS_FULL.tab)

These are the plotted [significant events](plot_events.PSI_plots.pdf) that were defined in the configuration file.
